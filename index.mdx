# Welcome to Koala Ops

Koala Ops is a platform that simplifies and automates the development and management of Kubernetes backend services while providing all the best practices for development and “day two” operations - out of the box.

We get it. We've been there. You just want to build your service and focus on your code, but somehow there are 20 different things you need to worry about, from various cloud configurations, yaml files, researching and setting up diffent tools. *Let us help.*

We'll get you up and running in minutes, configure the tools you want and need with good defaults out of the box. See how easy it is with Koala!

## Guiding principles

- [x] **Best practices** by default (smart rollout, secret management, monitoring, alerts, etc, etc)
- [x] Always **flexible** - we support multiple tools in each category and every tool or configuration can be overridden
- [x] **Transparency** - everything is done in your own repo and cloud with your full control.
- [x] **No lock-in** to your cloud provider, Koala, or any other 3rd party provider. 
- [x] Get going (e.g. creating a new service) in **minutes, not days**

## Features
- [x] Service catalog
- [x] GitHub integration
- [x] Start with our templates or bring your own repo with Dockerfile
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (to test, build, upload artifacts and deploy the service)
- [x] Smart rollouts - simply choose from recommended strategies such as Canary or Blue-Green, and we'll make it happen.
- [x] Manage multiple environments - with recommended setups out of the box, but always customizable. Manage the path from dev, staging and production, as well as spin up ephemeral environments on demand.
- [x] Full Observability stack (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing)
- [x] Alerts (via PagerDuty, Slack, SMS)
- [x] Env var management
- [x] Secret management
- [x] Ingress - configure networking to each environment of the service
- [x] TLS - we automate certificate provisioning for secure connections
