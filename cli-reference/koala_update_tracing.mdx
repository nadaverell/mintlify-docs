## koala update tracing

Instruments the service to export tracing information.

### Synopsis

Instruments the service to export tracing information.

Requires a Jaeger collector to be running in the cluster.

Only supported for Go at the moment. Operates by parsing the AST (Abstract
Syntax Tree) of the service's main.go file, assuming the format used by
Koala's Go server template.

Uses OpenTelemetry to instrument all HTTP endpoints, and sends the traces to 
the Jaeger collector address.
