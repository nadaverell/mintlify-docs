## koala update metrics

Instruments the service to export metrics.

### Synopsis

Instruments the service to export metrics.

Only supported for Go at the moment. Operates by parsing the AST (Abstract
Syntax Tree) of the service's main.go file, assuming the format used by
Koala's Go server template.

Uses OpenTelemetry to export metrics via the /metrics endpoint,
such that they can be collected by Prometheus or other backends.
