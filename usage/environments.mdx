# Environments

## Environments List
The environments section lists all of the environments that you have defined.
For each environment, you may see the k8s clusters that run it and the number of services that are deployed to the environment.

Support to add/remove environments directly from this section will soon be added. Currently, environments are simply defined for each service.

## Environment Page
When viewing a specific environment, you'll see the list of services that exist in it with some basic information about them such as their name, description, k8s cluster, etc. 

**Batch-Deploy:** You can also trigger a deployment of multiple services in the same environment at once. Simply select the version you want to deploy for each service, click trigger, and see the deploy workflow for each one.
