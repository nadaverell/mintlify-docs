# Services
The Services section allows you to create and manage all of your backend services in one place.

Each Koala Service represents a single service / microservice. If you're using a monorepo, it represents a workspace within your monorepo repository where a single service is contained.

The Services section enables you to view general information about your service. You can also see and manage its deployment status and current version in each of the environments to which you have deployed it (dev, staging, prod, etc.).
You can view the service's API spec, environment variables & secrets, and its logs.

## Create Service
For instructions on how to create a service in Koala, refer to the [Create Service](../getting-started/create-service.md) page in the Getting Started section.

KoalaOps currently supports only the creation of new services and their repositories from scratch.
Support for adding existing repositories will be added soon. If you would like to connect an existing repository, [contact us](mailto:support@koalaops.com), and we will be happy to assist.

## Services List
The Services List displays all of the services that have been added to KoalaOps.
It includes the service name, description, a link to its GitHub repo, and an option to remove it from KoalaOps.

## Service Page

### General
This section provides basic information about the service, such as its description, GitHub repo, and the container registry name. You can also view the deployment status in each of the environments where it is deployed.

### API
For services using the popular OpenAPI (Swagger) spec, you will be able to see the APIs exposed by your service and run API calls directly through the UI over the service in different environments.

- Choose the relevant environment at the top.
- Authenticate with the API if required.
- Interact with any of the API endpoints.

### Environments
Shows all the environments in which the service is deployed, including the cluster name, namespace, ingress status, etc.
This page also allows you to create new environments to deploy your service over. 

### Logs
Provides a basic interface to present recent logs for easy analysis. There's also a direct link to the log's tools interface for each of the environments.

### CI/CD
View recent deployments and their status. A quick link is provided for each deployment into the CI/CD tool.

### Env Variables & Secrets
This section allows you to view and edit the global vars and environment-specific env vars.

The Secrets sub-section (coming soon!) also helps you manage which secrets are provided to the pod from Kubernetes, as well as sync the secrets from any secret manager to the right namespace in the right Kubernetes cluster.

### Observability
Define your metrics collector and configuration.

### Deploy
Deploy an already-built container image to a selected enviroment, or trigger a new build & deploy workflow from any branch.
