### Env Variables & Secrets
This section allows you to view and edit the global vars and environment-specific env vars.

The Secrets sub-section (coming soon!) also helps you manage which secrets are provided to the pod from Kubernetes, as well as sync the secrets from any secret manager to the right namespace in the right Kubernetes cluster.
