The Services section allows you to create and manage all of your backend services in one place.

Each Koala Service represents a single service / microservice. If you're using a monorepo, it represents a workspace within your monorepo repository where a single service is contained.

The Services section enables you to view general information about your service. You can also see and manage its deployment status and current version in each of the environments to which you have deployed it (dev, staging, prod, etc.).
You can view the service's API spec, environment variables & secrets, and its logs.
