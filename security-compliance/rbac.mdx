title: 'Role Based Access Control'
---

All changes that are made to your configuration through the KoalaOps Portal or CLI are created as Pull Requests (PRs). Therefore, your existing repository RBAC settings and review processes are inherently in use by Koala for any change that is made to your backend services configuration. 

<Card title="Coming Soon" color="#ca8b04">
KoalaOps will soon support additional RBAC granularities, for example, control which users are allowed to:
- View certain areas of the product, such as the Control Plane.
- View only specific services and clusters.
- Create PRs with configuration changes.
