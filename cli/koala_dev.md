## koala dev

Run the service in development mode on a remote cluster

### Synopsis

Run the service in development mode on a remote cluster.
	
This uses 'skaffold dev' under the hood, and triggers a build+push+deploy 
workflow, performs port forwarding for easy local interaction, and streams 
logs.
In addition to running skaffold with the right params, this command also 
switches the kubectl context to the remote cluster.
